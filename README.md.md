The CSS Grid Layout Module creates a grid-based system that organizes content into rows and columns, making web page design more straightforward without relying on floats or positioning. A grid layout consists of a parent element and one or more child elements, which helps present content in a structured manner. This CSS_GRID project repository will demonstrate how to utilize a CSS grid, whether added or inline, within an HTML document using the "style" attribute.

An HTML element turns into a grid container when its display property is set to either grid or inline-grid. This functionality enables the effective arrangement of grid items within the designated layout. The vertical sections of grid items are referred to as columns, while the horizontal sections are known as rows. Additionally, other element properties can be applied to enhance the overall appearance of the grid.

Furthermore, the spaces that separate each column and row are called gaps. The lines that define the separations between columns are known as column lines, whereas the lines that distinguish rows are referred to as row lines. Together, these components form a cohesive and organized grid structure for web design.
